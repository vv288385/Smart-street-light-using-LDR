Project Title: Smart Street Light System Using LDR

Objective:

To design a smart street light system that automatically turns ON at night and OFF during the day using an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor).

Components Required:

LDR

Resistors

Transistor (BC547)

Relay

LED (to represent the street light)

9V Battery

Connecting wires

Breadboard


Working Principle:

The LDR detects the ambient light level.

When it’s bright (daytime), resistance is low and the light stays OFF.

When it’s dark (nighttime), resistance increases and the circuit turns the light ON using a transistor and relay mechanism.


Advantages:

Energy saving

Automation without microcontroller

Low cost


Applications:

Highways

Garden/pathway lights

Parking areas

Conclusion:

This project demonstrates a basic automatic system that saves power and operates without manual control. It is a foundation for smart city lighting systems.
