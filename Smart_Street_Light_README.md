# Smart Street Light System Using LDR

## Objective
To design a smart street light system that automatically turns ON at night and OFF during the day using an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor).

## Components Required
- LDR (Light Dependent Resistor)
- Resistors
- BC547 Transistor
- Relay
- LED (to represent the street light)
- 9V Battery
- Connecting wires
- Breadboard

## Working Principle
The LDR detects ambient light levels:
- **Daylight**: Low resistance â†’ Transistor remains OFF â†’ Street light OFF
- **Darkness**: High resistance â†’ Transistor switches ON â†’ Street light ON

## Features
- Automatically operates street lights based on light intensity
- Low power consumption
- Cost-effective and easy to build

## Applications
- Energy-saving street lighting
- Garden and outdoor lights
- Smart campus or smart city solutions

## Project Status
Complete and tested. Ideal for school or college electronics mini-projects.
